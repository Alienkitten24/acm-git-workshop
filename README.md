# **Today's project**

Think back to your very first CS project at William & Mary, or another school project you've done. What did you use to keep track of your progress on that project? Maybe you had multiple files to turn in?

This CSCI 141 project will have you create a name compatibility calculator like they used to have in the app store back in elementary school.

The workshop is meant to be accessible regardless if you've seen a software project or not- it should help you relate what you're used to and show why Git is nice to keep track of code!
